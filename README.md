📌 Project Focus: Data Governance Implementation for EasyCare Insurance & Financial Planning

📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive data governance and ethics framework tailored for EasyCare, an insurance and financial planning company. The study emphasizes data security, compliance with GDPR, risk management, customer trust, and ethical data practices.

The report explores the need for structured data governance, outlining key roles, responsibilities, operating models, and regulatory compliance measures for EasyCare. It also discusses ethical frameworks and their implications on data-driven decision-making.

🔍 Key Highlights
✅ Developed a structured Data Governance Program to improve data integrity, security, and compliance.
✅ Ensured GDPR compliance by establishing policies for data security, privacy, and risk mitigation.
✅ Defined organizational roles including Chief Data Officer, Data Stewards, Data Owners, and Risk Managers to oversee governance activities.
✅ Applied John Ladley’s 8-Phase Data Governance Framework for structured implementation.
✅ Ethical Audit: Compared Deontological (Duty-Based Ethics) vs. Utilitarian (Outcome-Based Ethics) in data practices.

📊 Data Governance Strategy & Implementation
🛡️ Key Governance Elements for EasyCare
Aspect	Implementation Strategy
